# Smart Attendance System Using ML-Based Face Recognition

A machine learning-based face recognition attendance system that allows educational institutions and organizations to automate and digitize attendance using face detection and recognition. 
This system registers student faces, marks attendance with real-time face recognition, and stores attendance data in CSV files.

## 🧠 Key Features

- Face Registration using OpenCV
- Real-time Face Detection and Recognition
- Subject-wise Attendance Marking
- Attendance Logging in CSV
- Email Notifications on Attendance
- Offline Functionality (No Internet Required)
- Simple GUI using Tkinter (Windows-compatible)
